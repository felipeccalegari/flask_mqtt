### MQTT with Flask

Simple Flask application to integrate MQTT protocol and subscribe to a topic called 'flask/iot'.

This application will also refresh automatically the new messaged received from MQTT, no need to refresh the browser.

The idea is to use this application as a template for future projects involving IoT technologies.
